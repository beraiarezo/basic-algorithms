# **Sliding Windows**

<p>
The sliding window technique is a popular algorithmic pattern used for solving problems involving arrays or strings. It involves creating a window or range over the elements of the array or characters of the string and adjusting this window based on the problem's requirements.

## When is the Sliding Window pattern appropriate to use?

the sliding window pattern is suitable for problems where you need to efficiently compute results for contiguous elements or characters with specific properties, ensuring optimal performance and ease of implementation.

> **Maximum Sum Subarray:** Finding the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of a fixed size k.

> **Smallest Subarray with Sum >= Target:** Finding the minimum length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to a given target.

> **Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters:** Finding the length of the longest substring with exactly K distinct characters.

> **Efficiency:** The sliding window technique optimizes time complexity compared to naive approaches by avoiding redundant computations.
